#  Foody – MERN Food Ordering App
Foody is an ongoing full-stack food ordering web application built to deepen my backend skills using the MERN stack. It allows users to browse menus, manage cart items, and securely place orders. The project demonstrates real-world use of REST APIs, modular architecture, and backend integration with authentication.
## Features
🍔 Browse food items by category

🛒 Add and remove items from cart

🔐 User registration and login

📦 Place and track orders (in progress)

⚙️ Backend with REST APIs using Express

## Things completed so far: 
- Server successfully set
- Built the authentication endpoint, and documented the entire process[ here ](https://www.notion.so/MERN-Food-Application-Docs-1888e670a18e809890addab0118ce9c4?pvs=4)
- Different files like controllers (to handle specific business logics), middleware, routes, and models have all been created.
- There are auth & validation middlewares used to protect the user routes and make validations from the frontend, respectively. 
- CreateUser and UpdateUser endpoint/business logic, including middleware and necessary validations, have been fully completed
